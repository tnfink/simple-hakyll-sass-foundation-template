After changing the Haskell code:
stack build

After changing the content of the site:
stack exec site build

Start wach mode:
stack exec site watch
(The site is served at http://127.0.0.1:8000 )

When you encounter problems:
stack exec site rebuild

The generated site is found in the _site directory. You can transfer its content to a HTML-server.
